 abstract = {We previously reported on MetaBAT, an automated metagenome binning software tool to reconstruct single genomes from microbial communities for subsequent analyses of uncultivated microbial species. MetaBAT has become one of the most popular binning tools largely due to its computational efficiency and ease of use, especially in binning experiments with a large number of samples and a large assembly. MetaBAT requires users to choose parameters to fine-tune its sensitivity and specificity. If those parameters are not chosen properly, binning accuracy can suffer, especially on assemblies of poor quality. Here, we developed MetaBAT 2 to overcome this problem. MetaBAT 2 uses a new adaptive binning algorithm to eliminate manual parameter tuning. We also performed extensive software engineering optimization to increase both computational and memory efficiency. Comparing MetaBAT 2 to alternative software tools on over 100 real world metagenome assemblies shows superior accuracy and computing speed. Binning a typical metagenome assembly takes only a few minutes on a single commodity workstation. We therefore recommend the community adopts MetaBAT 2 for their metagenome binning experiments. MetaBAT 2 is open source software and available at https://bitbucket.org/berkeleylab/metabat.},

abstract ={Large-scale recovery of genomes from isolates, single cells, and metagenomic data has been made possible by advances in computational methods and substantial reductions in sequencing costs. Although this increasing breadth of draft genomes is providing key information regarding the evolutionary and functional diversity of microbial life, it has become impractical to finish all available reference genomes. Making robust biological inferences from draft genomes requires accurate estimates of their completeness and contamination. Current methods for assessing genome quality are ad hoc and generally make use of a limited number of “marker” genes conserved across all bacterial or archaeal genomes. Here we introduce CheckM, an automated method for assessing the quality of a genome using a broader set of marker genes specific to the position of a genome within a reference genome tree and information about the collocation of these genes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CheckM using synthetic data and a wide range of isolate-, single-cell-, and metagenome-derived genomes. CheckM is shown to provide accurate estimates of genome completeness and contamination and to outperform existing approaches. Using CheckM, we identify a diverse range of errors currently impacting publicly available isolate genomes and demonstrate that genomes obtained from single cells and metagenomic data vary substantially in quality. In order to facilitate the use of draft genomes, we propose an objective measure of genome quality that can be used to select genomes suitable for specific gene- and genome-centric analyses of microbial communities.},

 abstract = {“Higher” termites have been able to colonize all tropical and subtropical regions because of their ability to digest lignocellulose with the aid of their prokaryotic gut microbiota. Over the last decade, numerous studies based on 16S rRNA gene amplicon libraries have largely described both the taxonomy and structure of the prokaryotic communities associated with termite guts. Host diet and microenvironmental conditions have emerged as the main factors structuring the microbial assemblages in the different gut compartments. Additionally, these molecular inventories have revealed the existence of termite-specific clusters that indicate coevolutionary processes in numerous prokaryotic lineages. However, for lack of representative isolates, the functional role of most lineages remains unclear. We reconstructed 589 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from the different gut compartments of eight higher termite species that encompass 17 prokaryotic phyla. By iteratively building genome trees for each clade, we significantly improved the initial automated assignment, frequently up to the genus level. We recovered MAGs from most of the termite-specific clusters in the radiation of, for example, Planctomycetes, Fibrobacteres, Bacteroidetes, Euryarchaeota, Bathyarchaeota, Spirochaetes, Saccharibacteria, and Firmicutes, which to date contained only few or no representative genomes. Moreover, the MAGs included abundant members of the termite gut microbiota. This dataset represents the largest genomic resource for arthropod-associated microorganisms available to date and contributes substantially to populating the tree of life. More importantly, it provides a backbone for studying the metabolic potential of the termite gut microbiota, including the key members involved in carbon and nitrogen biogeochemical cycles, and important clues that may help cultivating representatives of these understudied clades.},

    abstract = { Genome-resolved metagenomics has led to the discovery of previously untapped biodiversity within the microbial world. As the development of computational methods for the recovery of genomes from metagenomes continues, existing strategies need to be evaluated and compared to eventually lead to standardized computational workflows. Metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) represent individual genomes recovered from metagenomic data. MAGs are extremely useful to analyze uncultured microbial genomic diversity, as well as to characterize associated functional and metabolic potential in natural environments. Recent computational developments have considerably improved MAG reconstruction but also emphasized several limitations, such as the nonbinning of sequence regions with repetitions or distinct nucleotidic composition. Different assembly and binning strategies are often used; however, it still remains unclear which assembly strategy, in combination with which binning approach, offers the best performance for MAG recovery. Several workflows have been proposed in order to reconstruct MAGs, but users are usually limited to single-metagenome assembly or need to manually define sets of metagenomes to coassemble prior to genome binning. Here, we present MAGNETO, an automated workflow dedicated to MAG reconstruction, which includes a fully-automated coassembly step informed by optimal clustering of metagenomic distances, and implements complementary genome binning strategies, for improving MAG recovery. MAGNETO is implemented as a Snakemake workflow and is available at: https://gitlab.univ-nantes.fr/bird\_pipeline\_registry/magneto. IMPORTANCE Genome-resolved metagenomics has led to the discovery of previously untapped biodiversity within the microbial world. As the development of computational methods for the recovery of genomes from metagenomes continues, existing strategies need to be evaluated and compared to eventually lead to standardized computational workflows. In this study, we compared commonly used assembly and binning strategies and assessed their performance using both simulated and real metagenomic data sets. We propose a novel approach to automate coassembly, avoiding the requirement for a priori knowledge to combine metagenomic information. The comparison against a previous coassembly approach demonstrates a strong impact of this step on genome binning results, but also the benefits of informing coassembly for improving the quality of recovered genomes. MAGNETO integrates complementary assembly-binning strategies to optimize genome reconstruction and provides a complete reads-to-genomes workflow for the growing microbiome research community. }

ABSTRACT={Lignocellulose digestion in termites is achieved through the functional synergy between gut symbionts and host enzymes. However, some species have evolved additional associations with nest microorganisms that collaborate in the decomposition of plant biomass. In a previous study, we determined that plant material packed with feces inside the nests of Cornitermes cumulans (Syntermitinae) harbors a distinct microbial assemblage. These food nodules also showed a high hemicellulolytic activity, possibly acting as an external place for complementary lignocellulose digestion. In this study, we used a combination of ITS sequence analysis, metagenomics, and metatranscriptomics to investigate the presence and differential expression of genes coding for carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZy) in the food nodules and the gut of workers and soldiers. Our results confirm that food nodules express a distinct set of CAZy genes suggesting that stored plant material is initially decomposed by enzymes that target the lignin and complex polysaccharides from fungi and bacteria before the passage through the gut, where it is further targeted by a complementary set of cellulases, xylanases, and esterases produced by the gut microbiota and the termite host. We also showed that the expression of CAZy transcripts associated to endoglucanases and xylanases was higher in the gut of termites than in the food nodules. An additional finding in this study was the presence of fungi in the termite gut that expressed CAZy genes. This study highlights the importance of externalization of digestion by nest microbes and provides new evidence of complementary digestion in the context of higher termite evolution.}

abstract = {Xylan, the major hemicellulosic component of lignocellulose and the second most abundant polysaccharide after cellulose, contributes to the structural stability of wood and its recalcitrance to enzymatic digestion. The present study identifies Spirochaetes as primary agents of xylan degradation in the hindgut of wood-feeding higher termites, in contrast to the bovine rumen or the human colon, where Bacteroidetes are responsible for hydrolysis of xylan in grass or cereals. The presence of distinctive xylanases in Spirochaetes was so far undocumented to our knowledge. Their phylogenetic origin among gut bacteria of other phyla identifies horizontal gene transfer among the intestinal microbiota as an important driver in the evolutionary adaptation of higher termites to different lignocellulosic diets. Symbiotic digestion of lignocellulose in wood-feeding higher termites (family Termitidae) is a two-step process that involves endogenous host cellulases secreted in the midgut and a dense bacterial community in the hindgut compartment. The genomes of the bacterial gut microbiota encode diverse cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic enzymes, but the contributions of host and bacterial symbionts to lignocellulose degradation remain ambiguous. Our previous studies of Nasutitermes spp. documented that the wood fibers in the hindgut paunch are consistently colonized not only by uncultured members of Fibrobacteres, which have been implicated in cellulose degradation, but also by unique lineages of Spirochaetes. Here, we demonstrate that the degradation of xylan, the major component of hemicellulose, is restricted to the hindgut compartment, where it is preferentially hydrolyzed over cellulose. Metatranscriptomic analysis documented that the majority of glycoside hydrolase (GH) transcripts expressed by the fiber-associated bacterial community belong to family GH11, which consists exclusively of xylanases. The substrate specificity was further confirmed by heterologous expression of the gene encoding the predominant homolog. Although the most abundant transcripts of GH11 in Nasutitermes takasagoensis were phylogenetically placed among their homologs of Firmicutes, immunofluorescence microscopy, compositional binning of metagenomics contigs, and the genomic context of the homologs indicated that they are encoded by Spirochaetes and were most likely obtained by horizontal gene transfer among the intestinal microbiota. The major role of spirochetes in xylan degradation is unprecedented and assigns the fiber-associated Treponema clades in the hindgut of wood-feeding higher termites a prominent part in the breakdown of hemicelluloses.}
