# SnakeMAGs
SnakeMAGs is a workflow to reconstruct prokaryotic genomes from metagenomes. The main purpose of SnakeMAGs is to process Illumina data from raw reads to metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs).
SnakeMAGs is efficient, easy to handle and flexible to different projects. The workflow is CeCILL licensed, implemented in snakemake (run on multiple cores) and available for Linux.
SnakeMAGs was designed to build a Termite Data Base (TDB) which contains the genomes of termite-associates micro-organisms.
